# MauiPlate - Desktop System Management Application

## Overview
MauiPlate is a learning-focused desktop application built with .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) framework. It serves as a comprehensive system management solution that includes user management, role-based access control, tenant management, menu management, and resource management modules.

## Purpose
This project is primarily developed for educational purposes, demonstrating the implementation of a modern desktop application using .NET MAUI. It showcases best practices in desktop application development while providing practical system management functionalities.

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Handle user profiles and authentication
- **Role Management**: Configure and manage user roles and permissions
- **Tenant Management**: Multi-tenant system support
- **Menu Management**: Dynamic menu configuration
- **Resource Management**: Manage system resources efficiently

## Technical Stack
- **.NET MAUI**: Core framework for cross-platform desktop application
- **CommunityToolkit.Maui**: Enhanced UI components and utilities
- **Syncfusion Tools**: Advanced UI controls and components
- **Microsoft Extensions**: Logging and dependency injection
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access and management

## Architecture
